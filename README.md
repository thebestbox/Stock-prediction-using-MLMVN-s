# Stock-prediction-using-MLMVN-s
The goal of this project is to build a program which when given 6 months of highs and lows of stock data it will train and optimize 150 neural networks, 50 trained on 1 month of data, 50 on 2 months of data and 50 on 3.
Using the results from the networks a basic trade risk algorithm will be implimented based off of the std. dev. and abverage of the predictions to allow for optimized trades over the next week.
